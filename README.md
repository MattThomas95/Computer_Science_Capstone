# Computer_Science_Capstone
Machine learning application that predicts future COVID-19 cases and deaths in Tennessee

United_States_COVID-19_Cases_and_Deaths_by_State_over_Time.csv contains all the data used to train the prediction model. An updated .csv file can be found at this link https://healthdata.gov/dataset/united-states-covid-19-cases-and-deaths-state-over-time

machine_learning_model.ipynb was the inital Python code written in Jupyter Notebooks. The code was moved to Google Colab and optimized.

Capstone.ipynb is the final working application. The notebook needs to be connected to a hosted runetime and all cells need be ran in order for the web application to work.

The web application is hosted by Anvil and can be found here - https://br2uqiaya7wd4p4i.anvil.app/MIS7MPLIOHOTJBI22QRFAO5N/
