7. If the Google Colab session disconnects, the website will not function properly.
8. Follow steps 4 and 5 to reconnect the runtime.

### Repository File Information :
United_States_COVID-19_Cases_and_Deaths_by_State_over_Time.csv contains all the data used to train the prediction model. 
An updated .csv file can be found at this link https://healthdata.gov/dataset/united-states-covid-19-cases-and-deaths-state-over-time.

machine_learning_model.ipynb was the inital Python code written in Jupyter Notebooks. 
The code was moved to Google Colab and optimized.

Capstone.ipynb is the final working application. 
The notebook needs to be connected to a hosted runetime and all cells need be ran in order for the web application to work.

The web application is hosted by Anvil and can be found here - https://br2uqiaya7wd4p4i.anvil.app/MIS7MPLIOHOTJBI22QRFAO5N/. 
NOTE The functions on the website only work if the Capstone.ipynb is currently running.
The username is user and the password is github.
